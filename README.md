# Cartoon Network 90s Website Recreation

## Overview

This project was created during a hackathon where the goal was to recreate the look and feel of a 1990s website. I chose to recreate the Cartoon Network website, a classic hub for cartoons, games, and nostalgia.

## Features

- Bright, bold colors and iconic 90s fonts.
- Retro layout using elements, inline styles, and marquee text for that authentic old-school vibe.
- Classic Cartoon Network graphics and animations recreated from scratch.

## Inspiration

Cartoon Network’s original website was a fun and chaotic design reflecting the era’s web trends—this project aims to honor that quirky nostalgia.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Leveraging tags commonly used in 90s websites (frames, tables).
- **CSS**: Basic styling with inline and embedded styles.

- **Images**: Sourced retro logos and characters for authenticity.
